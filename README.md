# Aetheron Tech Radar

A living, opinionated map of our engineering stack — inspired by the Thoughtworks Radar, tailored to Aetheron.

## 🚀 Quick Start for Teams

**To add tech radar rules to your repository, paste this into Cursor:**
```
Follow the instructions in the MD file you can curl from https://radar.sandbox.aetheron.com/action-setup.md
```

**Or use this Slack command (replace YOUR_REPO_NAME):**
```
@Cursor repo=aetheronhq/YOUR_REPO_NAME Follow the instructions in the MD file you can curl from https://radar.sandbox.aetheron.com/action-setup.md
```

**You can also install the Radar MCP server in Cursor / Claude Code**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aetheron-radar": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "https://radar.sandbox.aetheron.com/radar-mcp.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Why this exists
- **Internal**: clear defaults, faster decisions, easier onboarding, a place to propose/track experiments, and shared "when to use X vs Y" guidance.
- **External**: signals we're modern and intentional, shows quality to candidates/clients, and serves as a strong tech‑marketing asset.

## How it works
Each item is tagged as one of:
- **Primary**: our default choice.
- **Consider**: use when the context merits it.
- **Experiment**: we're currently trialing this; promising but not default.
- **Avoid**: known tradeoffs or misfit for our goals.

Each entry includes a short rationale and "use when" notes. The radar is collaborative and owned by everyone.

## Contributing
Please scan the radar and open PRs/issues for:
- **Missing tools** you rely on
- **Placement changes** (e.g., should be Primary vs Consider)
- **Clearer "when to use" notes** or better alternatives
- **Experiments** you're running that could become our go‑to choice

Edit `public/radar-entries.json` to add/update technologies.

### Entry Format Example
```json
{
  "label": "TypeScript",
  "quadrant": 1,  // 0=Infrastructure, 1=Languages & Frameworks, 2=Services & LLMs, 3=Tools & Methodologies
  "ring": 0,      // 0=Primary, 1=Consider, 2=Experiment, 3=Avoid
  "summary": "Typed superset of JS for safer, scalable apps.",
  "decision": "Default for all new frontends and Node services.",
  "when_to_use": ["Web frontends", "Node APIs", "Shared libraries"],
  "consider_alternitive": ["Python-first data services"],
  "links": [{ "title": "Docs", "url": "https://www.typescriptlang.org/" }],
  "logo": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/simple-icons/simple-icons/icons/typescript.svg"
}

## Cursor IDE Integration

This radar can be converted into Cursor IDE rules to guide AI assistants based on our technology decisions.

### Using Radar Rules in Your Repository

To automatically sync tech radar rules to your repository, add this workflow with **just one line**:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/sync-cursor-rules.yml
name: Sync Organization Cursor Rules

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  sync-radar:
    uses: aetheronhq/shared-ci-workflows/.github/workflows/sync-org-cursor-rules.yml@main
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
```

This will:
- ✅ Sync rules from https://radar.sandbox.aetheron.com to your repo
- 🤖 Automatically update on every PR
- 💬 Comment when rules are updated
- 📁 Keep radar rules organized in a `/radar` subfolder

### How It Works

The conversion process:
- Groups technologies by quadrant and ring (Primary/Consider/Experiment/Avoid)
- Creates actionable rules for each technology
- Includes "when to use" guidance and alternatives
- Formats decisions so Cursor AI can make informed suggestions

The rules are organized in a `/radar` subfolder to:
- Keep them separate from project-specific rules
- Make updates and maintenance easier
- Allow clear namespace separation

### Benefits

Once Cursor rules are in place, the AI will:
- 🟢 **Suggest PRIMARY technologies** first (e.g., PostgreSQL for databases)
- 🟡 **Explain trade-offs** for CONSIDER technologies
- 🔴 **Warn against AVOID technologies** and suggest alternatives
- 🔵 **Note EXPERIMENT status** for technologies in trial

### For Organization Setup

See [ACTION_SETUP.md](public/action-setup.md) for detailed instructions on:
- Setting up the GitHub Action in your repositories
- Configuration options
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Getting started (local)
```bash
# Serve locally
./serve.sh
# Or: cd public && python3 -m http.server 8000

# Deploy to S3 (requires AWS credentials)
./deploy.sh
```

### MCP tool for programmatic access

We also publish a minimal MCP server exposing one `get_tech_stack_guidance` tool that returns entries from the hosted JSON with optional filters.
The MCP server gives you access to the radar data at the AI agent level, avoiding per-repo setup.

Client config example (Cursor/Claude-like):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aetheron-radar": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "https://radar.sandbox.aetheron.com/radar-mcp.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Tool: `get_tech_stack_guidance(quadrant?: int | int[], ring?: int | int[])`
- Quadrants: 0 Infrastructure, 1 Languages & Frameworks, 2 Services & LLMs, 3 Tools & Methodologies  
- Rings: 0 Primary, 1 Consider, 2 Experiment, 3 Avoid

Examples:
```json
{"tool":"get_tech_stack_guidance","arguments": {"quadrant": 1, "ring": [0,1]}}
```

### Editing Technology Entries

All technology entries are stored in `public/radar-entries.json`. This is the single source of truth for the radar data.
